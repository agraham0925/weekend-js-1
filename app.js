// CONCEPTUAL QUESTIONS
//1. How do we assign a value to a variable?
//2. How do we change the value of a variable?
//3. How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?

//STRINGS
// 1. Create a variable called firstVariable
let firstVariable;
// 		assign it the value of a string => "Hello World"
firstVariable = "Hello World";
// 		change the value of this variable to a number.
firstVariable = 69;
//		store the value of firstVariable into a new variable called secondVariable
let secondVariable = firstVariable
// 		change the value of secondVariable to a string.
secondVariable = "This is my new string";
// 		What is the value of firstVariable?
firstVariable = 69;

// 2. Create a variable called yourName and set it equal to your name as a string
let myName = "Alyssa Graham";
// 		Write an expression that takes the string "Hello, my name is " and the variable yourName so that it 
// 		returns a new string with them concatenated.
console.log("Hello, my name is " + myName);
